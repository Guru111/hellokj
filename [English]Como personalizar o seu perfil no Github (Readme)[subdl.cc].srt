People already have the contributions here

114
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,100
That table of comics that in fact

116
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:09,130
Had in my profile has none

118
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,140
Because I didn't use this account and as

120
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,200
If I do the invitations he's gonna

122
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,470
Increasing the

124

138
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,530
A lot of contribution a lot of invitation that I

140
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,780
I did in a private repository that's not

142
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:42,280
Public these comments they will only enter

144
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:45,049
In this table on this Count if I leave

With this readme file with all the

164
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,130
Information I want inside him and

166
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,290
Here it is already written as this

168
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,210
Repository is not how this is done

170
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,570
Project he's just a repository

172

Is a ballerini/regime race that is the

174
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,630
File that I wrote all these

176
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,910
Things then I'll get into this

178
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,630
Repository indeed is I here

180
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:26,370
Remembering inside my fake account and

182
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,960
I'm looking at my normal profile that

184
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,030
You can't even look I'll leave the

186
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,170
Link here in the description I will enter here

188
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,880
In this repository of mine which is that of the

190
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,710
Profile and cês can see that there is only look

192
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,600
There's only one file that folder here from

194
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,760
Workflows later I'll explain to you

196
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,130

334
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,699
To profile these emojis with

336
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,800

You don't even need it because it already appears

414
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,600
I put it there in my profile and

416
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,280
Pronouns I use It's also cool

418
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,110

Ballerini and two né that some already exist

430
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,760
There and now I'll take what's already in the

432
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,310
My original profile Let's open here the

434
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,260
Repository of this my profile that like the

436
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,500
People remember is the user's own name

438
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:34,460
Do it Rame né and I will open the file

440
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,570
Readme of the repository I will click on the

442
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,669
Little lapis when I click that one goes

444
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,100

446
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:42,840
Profile right when you click is from mine

448
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,490
Project but you can erase later here

450
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,870
There's no way people there when you click

452
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,890
In the little lapse you can see the code

454
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:52,020
And you can copy and paste

456
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,700
So come on I put it's a title

458
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,560

470
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,410
Giant images with total food

472
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,930
The stars I 've got the languages

474
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,029
With more

476
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,580
That's pretty cool what y'all always me

478
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:17,320
Ask how do you do it just

480
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,390
Copy and paste from my profile but it's not

482
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:23,170
Just that don't go there I copied here

484
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:25,149
So this div I'm gonna paste here with now

486
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,420
I already don't know where I'm gonna put I'm gonna

488
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:31,720
Put down there this information

490
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:34,839
Lives is and what's here doesn't have the tag

492
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,209
Is that we will be the clickable

494
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,010
Right when I click on these images he

496
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:41,350
Will you want to direct to my own

498
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,029
Kit profile Ruby And remembering that here

500
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,700
Oh, you're redirecting to Rafa

502
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:47,800
Ballerini that's not my profile right this

504
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,690
Fake and it won't be yours too if you

506
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,279
Copy you have to change here to the

508
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,290
Your user then I will already change here

510
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,790
For Rafael ballerini two or you

512
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,610
Can put to redirect to

514
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,589
Any other web site you want

516
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,480
And actually I think I'm gonna put

518
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:03,850
Here to redirect to my beak

520
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,490
Look how cool I think it's gonna be

522
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,890
Interesting in later I'll send in

524
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,899
My original by the way and soon after

526
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,120
Come the two image tags are the two

528
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:15,040
Images in fact but we also have

530
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,350
Than to realize that you look at what you're talking about

532
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,940
From the specters of Rafaella ballerini I

534
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,490
I'm not the Ballerina room just the room

536
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,800
Line 2 I don't have it all star

538
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,300
The invitation and much less languages

540
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,399
It's not because I haven't done anything yet in this

542
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,560
So we have to give

544
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,820
Look here at the URL I'll actually go from

546
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,370
Show you here that this is all

548
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:37,420
What's going on, right here's the time

550
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:40,180
Image that will be 180 m and here is the URL

552
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,209
That automatically makes this count of

554
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,329
Comics and also of the stars and tals

556
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:48,850
That you 've got eh you can see it's a

558
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:51,880
Big Ruby redimends see heaven then he

560
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,260
It's running there in the sky and there's some

562
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,959
Information that we are passing on

564
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,590
Own url that we can change by

566
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,540
Example and use name you

568
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,340
And leave the ballerini race otherwise will

570
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,350
To show up my information on your

572
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,900
Profile so we exchange Rafa here

574
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,090
Valeria for vallorini two here

576
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:12,290
Below also O have a user name you

578
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:16,040

So let's see more that show icons

582
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,020
What is this show there with the

584
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:23,560
Chow-chow and built I'll take away I'll

586
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:26,990
Put fake let's see how that

588
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,390
Happened to then he took the

590
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,700
Icons that had before the total Stars

592
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:34,170
Total with me then let me show of

594
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,860
New né chuchu

596
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,630
And then look just showed here the icons is

598
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,180
One thing you can configure the

600
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:45,750
Dracula theme Must exist other themes

602
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,550
We must have Dark, for example

604
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,889
Sending the first image, not remembering

606
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,720
Preview ó appeared the theme analysis can

608
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:53,699
Then I 've been walking really cool it's

610
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,170
Different already And then you can put this

612
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:57,540
Theme give down here too

614
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,779
Probably to the Dracula theme put

616
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:03,420
This city is the one that got listed people

618
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:05,279
They have a repository with all the

620
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,500
Information is they are project

622
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,240
Truth I'll leave here in the description

624
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,589
But I'm gonna show you guys from here

626
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,130
Little also what are the settings

628
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:16,320
That you can do look at what I

630
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,750
I thought it was this, right, maybe you can have a

632
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,730
Another with that same proposal is that

634
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,589
I had seen before but this one that I

636
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,389
Use it is only in their regime

638
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:27,149
Repository has all specifications

640
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:29,399
Look how much stuff How many themes

642
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:30,930
Different that you can put look

644
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,180
All the properties you can

646
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,130
Pass there in the URL so I recommend

648
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,940
Take a look even here I'll leave

650
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:43,540
Also in the script of the video that is in the

652
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,790
Repository there also in the description and

654
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,529
That's it people this is the obstetric kit and

656
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,410
For you also have a notion for

658
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:52,959
Example here in my profile You can see

660
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:57,760
That's one more so it starts there

662
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:59,170
With counting the most foods

664
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,910
Stars I think he really counts

666
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:06,459
Everything you know here by ixos quest and

668
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:09,700
You see for example in my profile that I

670
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:12,010
I'm the one more original then

672
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,140
Also have SS more if I'm not mistaken

674
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,790
So more and there you go growing

676
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,649
As the quantity increases there

678
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,990
Of stars like these things but

680
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:21,870
So people this is something to increase the

682
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,160
Our own ego isn't because in fact

684
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:27,100
No one enters the profile of others and

686
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,959
Stay it's more not so it's quite silly

688
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,430
Who knows, it's just to make it cute

690
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,920
Profile even why he already starts

692
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,190
With the most that is already a very cool note

694
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,040
So cool we can

696
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,420
And with our obstetric kit in fact not

698
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,130
Nothing is showing up here because I don't

700
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,050
I made no comment but if you have

Business sometimes a bugger knows has

Some profiles of some people that the

848
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,970
Size of a bugada so he doesn't stay

850
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:02,340
On the same line but sometimes he doesn't

852
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,560
Predicted it does not stay there in the profile is then

854

I be the Japanese and you can ride the

886
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:54,370
Your gif also actually you ride a

888
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:56,140
Photo and then you go in the creator of gifs and

Stayed interspersed you do different

894
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,550
Two images of yours and then she becomes one

896
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,340
GIF that's how I did my sent

898
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:09,670
There on the server of the disagreed at some

900
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:12,000
Message I copied the message link and there

902
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,860
Is the link of the gifc itself the tip

904
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,470
Below we'll put what the

906
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,890
Charge and the snake we are for

908
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:24,430
Making the agent uses the Rubi kit

910
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,930
Workflow is not the bit of Action I will not

912
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,970
Explain about it here in that video

914
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,590
Because otherwise it will extend a lot if you

916
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:32,590
Want the video explaining leaves here

918
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,870
In the comments and I have a post in the

920
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,750
Instagram

922
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:37,040

926
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:44,390

See it's a svg it's wont I copy and

930
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,200
I'm gonna stick here too but always

932
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,780
Remembering that these things you copy from

934
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,670
My profile they're from my profile So

936
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,380
The information that comes that neither

938
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,940
Rallies that the snake will eat from mine

940
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,760
Original profile is not the one I'm

942
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,980
Gluing but not just like changing here

958
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,200

960
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:20,210
Directly linked there with the hit Rehab

962
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,070

964
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,200
Here in mine as I spoke I'll leave
